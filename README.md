# AlgorithmDesign
Designed of a hybrid searching algorithm and subsequent implementation in C

DT265 is a postgraduate programme in the School of Computing, designed to provide an entry path for Bachelors Honours graduates in other numerate disciplines into graduate entry level careers in computing.

Every year, the DIT admissions office is tasked with collating applications for the DT265 course. This project is a simplified attempt to create a number of programs that would assist the admissions office in merging applications from various sources and sorting the applicants' details. In an effort to achieve this as efficiently as possible, I designed a hybrid algorithm using the well known algorithms Merge Sort and a modified Bubble Sort. I have also included the option to output search results to an external text file as I felt this might be a real world option that would be nice to have. 

These programs are executed from the command line.
